# ADHD-Notes

This is a React Native app designed to help people with ADHD organize themselves with a simple but powerful note-taking and schedule-planning app. It is still in early development and none of the planned capabilities are ready. The goal is to first develop all the UI and then start on the functional part per se. 

The stack planned until now for this app is as follows:

- React Native
- Expo
- Redux
- SQLite

I will use this repo as a means to study React Native and the technologies envolved and it should not be taken as a serious planed out project.
I don't think it is a highly desired project for forks and everything, but if you want feel free to do it.
